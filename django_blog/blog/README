# Blog Post Management Features

This project enables users to manage blog posts with full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Key Features:(using django built_in CBV to manipulate data)

    List Posts: Displays all posts on the homepage (/).(here we used Listview inherted properties we only give it the name of the template and moduls and context name and how to order the data)
    View Post: Shows full content of a post (/post/<int:pk>/).
    Create Post: Authenticated users can create new posts (/post/new/).
    Edit Post: Only the post author can edit their posts (/post/<int:pk>/edit/).
    Delete Post: Authors can delete their posts after confirmation (/post/<int:pk>/delete/).

# Permissions:

    Authenticated Users: Required to create posts. (we used loginrequeredmixins and ...)
    Post Authors: Only authors can edit or delete their posts.

# URL Patterns:

    / – List posts
    /post/<int:pk>/ – View post details
    /post/new/ – Create new post
    /post/<int:pk>/edit/ – Edit post
    /post/<int:pk>/delete/ – Delete post

# Testing:

    Check CRUD operations, permissions, and navigation between views.
